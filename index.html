            <p>My name is Timothy Steele, and I am a computer science major at BYU-Idaho.  
                I enjoy problem-solving and learning new things.</p>
            
            <p>My most recent project was to create an Android app for a small business consultant.
               By doing that, I learned how break down a project into small tasks, and 
               how to be resourceful to learn how to do new things and find answers to
               my problems.</p>
            
            <p>I look forward to gaining more experience with web development on 
            the server side.  I like using technology, and I'm excited to become capable of creating it!</p>
